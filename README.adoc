= Sample gradle CI / CD

This is a sample gradle project that tests various continuous integration and delivery services.
It is a very simple spring boot based web application.

== Travis CI

- https://travis-ci.org is a continuous integration service that build the github repository after each push to the
configured branch.
- current repository: https://travis-ci.org/westernacher-solutions/sample-ci-cd
- Needs a link:.travis.yml[.travis.yml] configuration file.

== Snap CI

- https://snap-ci.com
- requires organization authorization

== Codefresh

- https://codefresh.io
- Does not support github organisations directly but can be configured with any github URL.
- Codefresh web ui shows 'not found'. :(

== zeit now

- https://zeit.co
- one time preparation: `npm install -g now`
- for build and deployment run: `now`
- The very first run of `now` asks for your email address.
- Works like a charm! Now copies the target URL into the clipboard.

== use your own docker

- build image: `docker build . -t sample-ci-cd`
- start a fresh container: `docker run -it --rm -p8080:8080 sample-ci-cd`
- navigate to http://localhost:8080

== run it locally without docker

- build and test it: `./gradlew build`
- start the webapp: `./gradlew bootRun`
- navigate to http://localhost:8080
